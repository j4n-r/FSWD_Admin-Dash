## The Problem
Professors need an easy and effective way to facilitate online discussions and interactions among their students. Traditional messaging apps lack the necessary administrative control and transparency required to prevent misuse, manage student groups flexibly, and maintain academic integrity.

Specific pain points include:

* Difficulty managing multiple student groups quickly and efficiently
* Lack of transparency, making it challenging to monitor and prevent misuse
* Limited control over group creation, deletion, and management

## Our Solution

We offer a dedicated web-based chat platform designed specifically for professors and academic environments. The platform provides robust administrative controls allowing professors to easily:

* Create, reorder, and delete student groups instantly
* Monitor all student communications transparently to prevent misuse and facilitate productive discussions
* Maintain full administrative oversight, ensuring academic integrity and student safety

The intuitive web interface differentiates clearly between user roles:

* **Professors (Admins)**: Full administrative capabilities including group and user management, as well as complete visibility into student interactions.
* **Students**: Access to group chats and communication features, facilitating seamless and organized academic discussions.

This will be a one-off solution, meaning the application is designed for use by a single professor per instance, without multi-admin support in this initial version. Future enhancements, such as dedicated course management, are contingent on available development time.

## Target User

The primary target users are:

* Professors who require a secure and transparent platform for managing class discussions
* Students participating in organized group discussions or projects under academic supervision
