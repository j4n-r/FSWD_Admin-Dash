## The problem

Company Y wants to have internal communication but they do have some requirements.
- Admin dashboard for user and group managing
- Web view chat
- View stats like how many messages where send
- Instant messaging
- Full transparency over all messages
- Self hosted so it runs on their own servers

## Our solution

The web view provides different functionality based on the users role.
Normal users can only use the chat app. 
Admin users can manage normal users, groups and their members.

## Target user
The target would be companies in general.

The main user based on that would be: 
- Company employees who are using the chat app
- IT admins who are managing the other users

## Customer journey
TODO
