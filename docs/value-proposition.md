## The problem

Company Y wants to have internal communication but they do have some requirements.
- Admin dashboard for user and group managing
- Web view chat
- View stats like how many messages where send
- Instant messaging
- Full transparency over all messages
- Self hosted so it runs on their own servers

## Our solution

The web view provides different functionality based on the users role.
Normal users can only use the chat app. 
Admin users can manage normal users, groups and their members.

## Target user

Company Employees, IT Admins

## Customer journey

[Illustrate the customer journey, from the app's entry point to a completed task. You might want to show the customer journey as (schematic) screen flows.]
